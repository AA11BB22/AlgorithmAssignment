Please **don't** copy for students in the same course and especially same lab section.

## Log
1. Implement Boyer Moore's String Search Algorithm. **(Done)**
2. Read a text file, and accept the pattern (string) from user. **(Done)**
3. Show the pattern matching in every step. **(Done)**
4. Run your program for different cases.
  * Best Case, no matches. **(Done)**
  * Average Case, *some where in between.*
  * Worst Case, pattern is length of one *or* matched at every index. **(Done)**
5. Report - running time vs input size, n. **(Done)**
  * Write a function to simulate and write the input size and running time to a text file (csv format) **(Done)**
  * Use R to read the text file, generate scatter plot and add a regression line (if possible). **(Done)**
6. Prepare for presentation. **(Done)**

## Disclaimer
* An error will occur if there is a \ in the input as \ is a special character for C++ or when input is length of 0.
