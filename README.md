Please **don't** copy for students in the same course and especially same lab section.

## Log
1. Implement Boyer Moore's String Search Algorithm. **(Done)**
2. Read a text file, and accept the pattern (string) from user.
3. Show the pattern matching in every step. **(Done)**
4. Run your program for different cases.
  * Best Case, no matches.
  * Average Case, *some where in between.*
  * Worst Case, pattern is length of one *or* matched at every index.
5. Report - running time vs input size, n.
  * Write a function to simulate and write the input size and running time to a text file (csv format)
  * Use R to read the text file, generate a scatterplot and add a regression line (if possible).
6. Prepare for presentation.
